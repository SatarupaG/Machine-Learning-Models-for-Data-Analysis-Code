# Machine-Learning-Models-for-Data-Analysis-Code
This repository hosts the python codes (jupyter notebooks) for building machine learning models that can:<br>
(1) generate predictions <br>
(2) generate recommendations and <br>
(3) automate routine tasks

## Learning Outcomes 
1. Implemented classification algorithms by using various sklearn libraries such as Logistic Regression, Logictic regression, Decision Tree Classifier, etc.
2. Implemented clustering models such as K-means and hierarchal models. 
3. Implemented dimension reduction methods such as PCA. 
4. Implemented Association rules.
5. Implemented Ensembles methods.
6. Buit neural networks.
